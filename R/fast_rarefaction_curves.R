#' Rapidly calculate rarefaction curves at specified Hill numbers
#'
#' This function uses the `rmvhyper()` function from the `extraDistr` package to rapidly estimate rarefaction across your OTU table. This makes it much faster than the `rarefy_even_depth` function from `phyloseq`, or the manual rarefaction performed in `iNEXT`.
#' @param physeq a phyloseq object containing an otu_table of NON-NORMALIZED, INTEGER feature counts. Do not use rarefied, normalized, or relative counts.
#' @param iterations how many times alpha diversity should be calculated at each step for each sample
#' @param steps how many equally spaced steps at which to rarefy for each sample
#' @param seed an integer to set the random seed
#' @returns a dataframe with estimated alpha diversity at three hill numbers (hill0 - hill2) at an specified number of equally spaced depths for all samples in long-format.

#' Estimate alpha diversity in a given sample of the OTU table

#' This function works under the hood in the `fast_rarefaction_curves` function; not recommended for user.
#' @param otu_vector vector of NON-NORMALIZED read counts for each OTU in a single sample
#' @param steps how many equally spaced steps to rarefy for each sample
#' @param iterations how many times alpha diversity should be calculated at each step for each sample

#' @param seed an integer to set the random seed
#' @returns a dataframe with estimated alpha diversity at three hill numbers (hill0 - hill2) at an specified number of equally spaced depths for that sample.
